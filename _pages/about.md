I’m Yiqing Xu, a CS Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore advised by Prof. [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/). Previously, I obtained double degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from National University of Singapore.

I am currently a visiting Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and Prof. [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/index.html).

My research on Robot Learning focuses on translating human objectives into signals for machine optimization. I design algorithms and learn representations to align AI agents more closely with human objectives, enabling them to better understand and assist humans.
 
I've been working on algorithm research and theoretical analysis of inferring reward functions (Inverse RL) from limited data. Recently, I've used large language models to learn reward functions for motor skills through self-alignment. My ongoing work addresses the challenge of defining and solving robotics tasks with ambiguous and multi-factorial objectives, such a ``tidying up a table", using more flexible and comprehensive frameworks than conventional reward mechanisms.
