I'm Yiqing Xu, a CS Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/). Previously, I obtained double degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from NUS.

I was a visiting Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and Prof. [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/index.html) from September 2023 to February 2024.

My research focuses on translating human objectives into signals for robotic optimization. I design *inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms* and develop *compositional hierarchical representations* to better align robots with human goals, enabling them to understand and assist people more effectively.

I've been working on algorithm research and theoretical analysis for inferring reward functions from limited data. My latest work, ["Set It Up!"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11928), tackles the challenge of grounding under-specified instructions, such as "set up a Chinese dining table for two," in tabletop arrangement tasks. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates semantic inference from large language models with geometric reasoning from pre-trained diffusion models of basic object relationships.

I'm excited to extend this neuro-symbolic framework to a wider range of robotic tasks, such as generating complex 3D structures from simple sub-units and effectively chaining skills through compositional skill functions. If you'd like to chat more, feel free to email me!
