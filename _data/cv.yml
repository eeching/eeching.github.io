      description:
        - Advised by Prof. David Hsu
        - Designed IRL methods to scale up reward learning (Inverse RL) to long-horizon, high-dimensional tasks.
        - Developed methods to learn human objectives from diverse sources—demonstrations, language instructions, pre-trained models, and synthetic data—and translated these signals into optimization.
        - Built a simulator and benchmark for the Differentiable Deformable Object Manipulation methods.
