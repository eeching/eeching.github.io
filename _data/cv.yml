      description:
        - Advised by Prof. Prof. Leslie Kaelbling and Prof. Tomás Lozano-Pérez
        - Building a system to ground and optimize common-sense and multi-factorial objectives such as ``tidiness''. In particular, we ground the concept using multiple Diffusion Models (DMs) for the basic object relationships and optimize them jointly.

      description:
        - Advised by Prof. David Hsu
        - Designed IRL methods to scale up reward learning (Inverse RL) to long-horizon and high-dimensional tasks.
        - Built a simulator and benchmark for the Differentiable Deformable Object Manipulation methods.
        - Learnt/represented human objectives through various data forms such as demonstration, unstructured play, and foundational models.
